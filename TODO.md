# TODO
* Need to get some images from an early ended mission so we can start figuring out how to stage those
* Need to figure out how to mask multiple versions of the same image (find multiple copies of a template)
* Need to split out relevant sections like we did with the header section so it can be parsed
* At which point we can start parsing data out of sections of the images

# DONE
* ~Need to identify which game category we're using (i.e naval/ground/air)~
* ~Need to figure out how to mask portions of images that confuse tesseract (i.e, the war thunder specific symbols)~
* ~Need to identify the two other game screens (the results screen and the battle economy screen)~
* ~Need to create a command to iterate through the error directories and try and re-do them~
