# TODO
* Need to figure out how to matched portions of images that confuse tesseract (i.e, the war thunder specific symbols)
* Need to identify the two other game screens (the results screen and the battle economy screen)
* At which point we can start parsing data out of sections of the images

# DONE
* ~Need to identify which game category we're using (i.e naval/ground/air)~
